# hello-world
its my first try at this.

Hello everyone. 
I would like to say that this is going to be important to me, that it is the start of a new era im my life, 'an era of programming and novelties, and excitement and whatnot', but the truth is the following: I will lose interest in this. No matter how excited I'm about it right now, it might take a week, or a couple of days, but it's inevitable that I'll eventually grow uninterested in this. That much is clear to me.
Time and time again, I enter the following cycle:

1) I get into a routine. After all, I need to be organized with my time so as to encompass both leisure and uni activities in my development;
2) I get bored. I just get bored. Not of one thing, but of the entirety of it. It's like one boring class kills my excitement for the following one. Much like a plague; 
3) I find a hobbie. Now it's this git thing. 
4) I drop it.

Anyways, I'm bored. And I wish I was a great writer. I am definitly really bad in expressing myself, so much that I sound super stupid when talking. I FORGET WORDS ALL THE TIME. I have a lot of -pauses- in my speech. I sweat when I talk in public. 

I'll stop rambling. In sum, I'm a nervous speechear, dumb-sounding, bored constantly kind of dude.
